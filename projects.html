<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

<p>All these ideas build on work discussed in class, and are least partially novel. The Litus and Lein papers were based on work done in this class.

<ul>
<li>Joint recharging decisions: show that robots can achieve more discounted work if they jointly decide their battery threshold to go recharge, compared to any fixed threshold. See [Berenz:2012] for a single robot model.

<li>Distributed simultaneous task allocation & navigation: Can you modify the LOST framework to do optimal load balancing between multiple food sources? 
  Possible approaches:
  <ul>
    <li>Add additional information to the crumb cost label.
   <li>Use a FASR-type method to change a robot's choice of which trail to use.
  </ul>
<li>Adaptive spatial interference reduction: can you get a robot population to adaptively switch between individual foraging and bucket-brigading depending on the current spatial interference? See [Lein:2009] for a partial solution.

<li>FLOST: Investigate adding flocking behaviour to LOST robots, in addition to obstacle avoidance. Can you reduce spatial interference and terrain coverage to find better trails?

<!-- <li>Energy-aware foraging: investigate the 
-->

<li>Daydream LOST: Can a robot build a world model online, then simulate LOST in the model to find efficient paths without spending all that energy in the real world?

<li>Reinforcement learning for local obstacle avoidance with cooperating (and possibly uncooperating?) dynamic obstacles. Can you learn a control policy from sensor data that beats RVO?

<li>Ordering strategies in the Frugal Feeding Problem: devise and evaluate distributed heuristics for choosing the order of individual rendezvous in the FFP. See [Litus:2007]

<li>Pheromone Robotics: In [Payton:2001] Pheromone robots deploy themselves as stationary graph nodes. If we allow nodes to continue moving, could we usefully combine Payton's exploration functionality with formation control? 

<li>Robot sheepdog teams: devise novel control algorithms for multiple robot sheepdogs to move a flock around an obstacle course. Ideally, the methods would scale to any number of sheepdogs >= 3 and any number of flock creatures. 

<li>Multi-robot area coverage with fractal trajectories: extend [Sadat:2015] to multiple robots.

<li>Decentralize Amazon's Kiva robots. Devise a distributed algorithm that addresses the Kiva planning problem, and competes with a centralized planning approach. <a href="https://vimeo.com/113374910">Video</a>. This application is very important with lots of <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/locus-robotics-warehouse-automation-robots">players in the space</a>.

<li> Cooperative manipulation: Can you extend Lily's recent work on light-field controlled robots to transport large objects? See <a href="https://github.com/rtv/push">Push code at GitHub</a>.
